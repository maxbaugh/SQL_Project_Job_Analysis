# Background
Driven by a mission to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to triangulate top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.

Data originates from [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql). It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I utilized several key tools: 

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My default database management tool for executing SQL queries
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opporunities in the field. 

```sql
SELECT job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND job_location = 'Anywhere'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
```

Insights on the top 10 highest paying data analyst jobs:

- **Diverse Job Titles:** Despite all roles falling under the umbrella of data analysis, the job titles vary significantly, from "Data Analyst" to "Director of Analytics" and "Associate Director- Data Insights." This diversity suggests a range of responsibilities and seniority levels within the field, catering to different skill sets and career trajectories.

- **Salary Disparity:** The salary range among the top 10 highest paying data analyst jobs is considerable, with the highest salary at $650,000 and the lowest at $184,000 per year. This disparity may be attributed to factors such as industry, company size, location, and the specific skill set and experience required for each role.

- **Remote Work Opportunities:** The job locations are specified as "Anywhere," indicating remote work flexibility for these positions. This highlights a growing trend in the job market, where employers are increasingly offering remote or hybrid work arrangements, enabling candidates to work from various locations without compromising on salary or job responsibilities.

### 2. Top Paying Skills
To identify the top paying skills I narrowed my search to Remote Data Analyst roles with skills that pay the highest paying salaries. 

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM job_postings_fact
        LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND job_location = 'Anywhere'
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)
SELECT top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
```
 Analyzing the skills required for these top 10 data analyst roles reveals some interesting patterns:
